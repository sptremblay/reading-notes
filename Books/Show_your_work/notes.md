## 1 You don't have to be a genius

Creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds.

Being a valuable part of a scenius is not ncessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to conribute - the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start.

We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others.

Online, everoyone - the artist and the curator, the master and the apprentice, the expert and the amateur- has the ability to contribute something.

amateur: the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love, regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career - who often has the advantage over the professionnal.

They take chances, experiment, and follow their whims. Sometimes, in the process of doring things in an unprofessional way, they make new discoveries. "in the beginners's mind, there are many possibilities" Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki.

The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing.


The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.

Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.

If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share.

"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.Because almot everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. Your already naked." Steve Jobs

I'm not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I'm going to make them happen, and if people think I'm an idiot I don't care.

## 2 Think process, not product

There's "painting" the noun, and there's paiting the verb. As in all kinds of work, there is a distinction between the painter's process, and the products of her process.

To all viewers but yourself, what matters is the product: the finished artwork. To you, and you alone, what matters is the process: the experience of shaping the artwork.

human beings are interesed in other human beings and what other human beings do.

Whatever the nature of your work, there is an art to what you do, and there are people who would eb interested in that art, if only you presented it to them in the right way. In fact, sharing your process might actually be most valuable if the products of your work aren't easily shared, if you're still in the apprentice stage of your work, if you can't just slap up a portfolio and call it a day, or if your process doesn't necessarily lead to tangible finished products.

Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thgouths down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at diffent stages in your process. Shoot video of your working. This isn't about making art, it's about simply keeping track of what's going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal - these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones.
